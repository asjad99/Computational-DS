## About

This work in this repo explores the intersections of technology, science, art, and design. We explore emergent phenomena in real-life systems (i.e. cities, mobility), sociotechnical systems (i.e. social networking sites, Wikipedia), and human-computer interaction. 


The projects have been inspired by the work being done at following labs: 
  - [Stanford Comptational Imaging Lab](https://www.computationalimaging.org/) 
  - MIT Media lab 
  - https://comet.dlsu.edu.ph/

Particular focus is on Computational Imaging, AR and Graphics
