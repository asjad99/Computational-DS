### NLP Tasks: 

NLP is a broad field, encompassing a variety of tasks, including:


- Part-of-speech tagging: identify if each word is a noun, verb, adjective, etc.)
- Named entity recognition NER): identify person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, etc)
- Question answering
- Speech recognition
- Text-to-speech and Speech-to-text
- Topic modeling
- Sentiment classification
- Language modeling
- Translation
